I just recently got an Xbox One. I also have gotten my first dog 4 months ago, she is a terrier/mix and she is 6 months old right now. I live with my dad and grandma right now and my mom and brother are still in oklahoma. They will be moving here with us this summer.Me and my dad will be going back to oklahoma to get them and all of our stuff that we have over there, I can also use that time to go and meet my friends that I left over there.</font>

<font size="5"><font color="#0404B4">App Inventor:</font><font size="4">When I first started App Inventor I was really confused and lost, but once I started to get used to it, it just kinda became easy and fun!I made an app that is easy to use and time consuming. Its a drawing type game that you use when you are bored or just have nothing to do. When you are done drawing you just shake and the picture dissapears!The app is meant for anyone that is bored and has nothing to do.</font>

<font size="5"><font color="#0404B4">Khan Academy:</font><font size="4">When we started khan academy, we were just learning the basics of html and css, at first no one really payed a lot of attention but then they started to realize that it was a lot of hard work and really confusing unless you payed attention to the videos. Khan Academy was, in my opinion, very helpful with html and css, it showed me the basics of html and css and it really helped me with the projects that followed khan academy.
