Its a drawing type game that you use when you are bored or just have nothing to do. When you are done drawing you just shake and the picture dissapears!The app is meant for anyone that is bored and has nothing to do.</font>

Khan Academy was, in my opinion, very helpful with html and css, it showed me the basics of html and css and it really helped me with the projects that followed khan academy.

Notepad++ comes with a few features that really helped us with the website. When you start  akinga code that Notepad++ recognizes, it gives you the option to click on a code that auto fills.

Guess Game:The guess game project was the first of 3 games we made with the canopy program, and also the first python game we created. With this project we had to look up some code that we didnt know and the other code that we remembered from Khan Academy.
<div align=center />
Lucky 7: The Lucky 7 game was the 2nd game we made with Python on Canopy,How it works is that we made a code were you roll and if you land a 7 you get money in your bank and you just keep rolling until you run out of money.
<div align=center />
Hang Man: Hang Man was the final game we made on canopy, and how it works is the game generates a random work from a word pool you make and you have to guess the word in under a certain amount of tries.
